sentence=A library for using a simple mechanical push (momentary) button as a momentary button, a latching button, a counter, an enumerator, and more.
paragraph=The library allows a mechanical momentary button to be used as a virtual button with different functionality.  The library implements the behavior of a momentary button, a latching button, a counter, an enumerator, and more.  It also makes it very easy to develop buttons with your own custom behavior.  The Bounce2 library is used to add debouncing functionality.
